# Odin Project #22: Basic Informational Site

Originally the goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a simple information site by setting up a Node.js server and 4 HTML pages. The server was very basic and served HTML pages according to the URL. Styling wasn't the goal of this project, so it's looking pretty ugly. I added some Bootstrap styles by trial and error since I've only created my own CSS styles so far. The project has been refactored to use Express instead.

I started and finished this project in February 2024.
