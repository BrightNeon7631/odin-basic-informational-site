# Odin Project #22: Basic Informational Site

The goal of this Odin Project assignment was to create a simple information site by setting up a node.js server and 4 html pages. The server is very basic and serves HTML pages according to the URL. Styling wasn't the goal of this project, so I added some Bootstrap styles by trial and error since I'd only created my own CSS styles so far.

I started and finished this project in February 2024.
